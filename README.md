# Airline Safety Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation safety statistics for 56 major global airlines from 1985 to 2014 using Power BI. The dataset includes information on incidents, accidents, fatalities, and safety records, visualized through interactive reports and dashboards.

## Dataset Description
- **Primary Dataset**: "Airline Safety" containing safety statistics for 56 major airlines (1985-2014)
- **Secondary Dataset**: "Airlines" containing additional airline information
- **Data Connection**: Established relationships between datasets for integrated analysis

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Data Preparation & Loading
- Imported and structured airline safety datasets
- Established data connections between related datasets
- Prepared data for statistical analysis

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- **General Statistics**: Overall safety metrics and trends
